# Katczinsky21's Diff21
## Semestral Work from PA2, FIT CTU, 2019/20

Command line tool Diff21, which can compare 3 types of file: bianry, text and json. Except the standard comparations between same
file types, Diff21 can compare files with different types. Folder comparations are also possible. When comparing file and folder, file
is looked up in folder, and if folder contains file with same type and name, comparation will take place. Text files can be even compared
case sensitive and insensitive or can ignore whitespaces. Diff21 can also check syntax when loading json file.
